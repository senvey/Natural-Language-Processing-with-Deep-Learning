# Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning

**Class assignments for Stanford [CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)**.

This is a copy and ongoing working out for [archived materials used for Winter 2018](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1184/syllabus.html) as I'm going through [recorded videos on YouTube for Winter 2017](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6). It was said on the class homepage that recorded videos for Winter 2019 would be available online later.
